# SimulationMATLAB

- AorticArcSim: Simulation framework for a catheter moving through the aortic arch, the model of the catheter is not real, it moves as if you could control 2DOF in a 2 proyection perfectly, which is not the case in normal catheter for TAVI surgery
- CatheterDOFSim: Simulation used for experimentation.
