I want to thank all the people, family and friends, that supported me one way or another before and during the course of my masters. Special thanks to Joaquin Campos, who supported my academic way even before this journey started, to my brothers and parents that have been there to support me even from far away whenever I needed it. Finally, special thanks to Tanya, Claudia and Roland Hansalik, for being the family I needed in Switzerland.
